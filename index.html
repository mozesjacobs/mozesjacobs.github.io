<p>I am a Shanahan Foundation Predoctoral Researcher working at the AI Institute
   for Dynamics Systems at the University of Washington (UW). I graduated with a
   B.S. in Computer Science from UW in June 2022. I am currently applying to
   PhD programs in AI and Computer Vision. I am primarily interested in
   generative modeling. During my undergrad, I worked with Dr. Rajesh Rao in 
   the Neural Systems Lab and with Dr. William Noble in the Noble Lab.
