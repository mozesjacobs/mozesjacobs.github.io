<h2>About</h2>
<p>Hello! I am a second-year computer science PhD student at Harvard University,
   advised by Professor <a href="http://www.demba-ba.org">Demba Ba</a>. I am supported by the 
   <a href="https://www.harvard.edu/kempner-institute/opportunities/the-kempner-institute-graduate-fellowship/">Kempner Institute Graduate Fellowship</a>.
   My research interests are primarily in computer vision and generative modeling. 
   I'm also interested by exploring and drawing inspiration from ideas in theoretical neuroscience to augment vision models. 
   I'm specifically interested in object-centric learning and developing vision models that can decompose scenes into their individual entities.
   Previously, I worked at the <a href="https://dynamicsai.org">AI Institute in Dynamic Systems</a> with
   <a href="https://amath.washington.edu/people/j-nathan-kutz">Nathan Kutz</a> and 
   <a href="https://ryraut.github.io">Ryan Raut</a>.
   I earned my B.S. in computer science from the <a href="https://www.cs.washington.edu">Allen School</a> at the
   <a href="https://www.washington.edu">University of Washington</a>, where I worked with <a href="https://www.rajeshpnrao.com">Rajesh Rao</a>
   and <a href="https://noble.gs.washington.edu/~wnoble/">William Noble</a>.
