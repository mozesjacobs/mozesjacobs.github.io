<p>I am a Shanahan Foundation Predoctoral Researcher working at the AI Institute
   for Dynamics Systems at the University of Washington (UW). I graduated with a
   B.S. in Computer Science from UW in June 2022. I am currently applying to
   PhD programs in AI and Computer Vision. I am primarily interested in
   generative modeling. During my undergrad, I worked with Dr. Rajesh Rao in 
   the Neural Systems Lab and with Dr. William Noble in the Noble Lab.

<h1>Current Work</h1>
<p>Governing equations can be considered as a fundamental type of generative
   model. Currently, machine learning approaches can discover governing equations
   that describe deterministic dynamical systems. However, current approaches are not
   as well suited to model stochastic dynamics. I am developing approaches to
   discover the parameters of stochastic differential equations and generate new
   stochastic trajectories. I developed
   <a href="https://github.com/mozesjacobs/HyperSINDy" target="_blank">HyperSINDy</a>,
   a method that uses hypernetworks and amortized variational inference to discover
   parameters of differential equations (i.e. the Lorenz system).

<h1>Past Projects</h1>

<h2>Gradient Origin Predictive Coding</h2>
<p>I did my Undergraduate Honors Thesis, ``Gradient Origin Predictive Coding'',
   under Dr. Rajesh Rao. In short, I created an encoder-less VAE
   that performed inference using the gradient of the variational loss. You can find it
   <a href="gopc.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. 
</p>



<h2>PASTIS</h2>
<p>In the Noble Lab, I helped develop
   <a href="https://github.com/hiclib/pastis" target="_blank">PASTIS</a>, a
   Poisson-based algorithm that infers 3-D chromatin structures from Hi-C
   contact count maps.
