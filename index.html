<p>Hello! I am a first-year computer science PhD student at Harvard University,
   advised by Professor Demba Ba. My research interests are primarily in
   computer vision and generative modeling. I am studying how we can build
   build visual systems that fully understand visual scenes, which involves
   being able to decompose scenes into objects and their relationships. I'm
   particularly intrigued by problems like image generation
   (e.g. text-to-image diffusion models) and video generation. I am curious how
   we can bake inductive biases into generative models for these problems.

<h1>Current Work</h1>
<p>Updating very soon.
</p>

<h1>Past Projects</h1>

<h2>Gradient Origin Predictive Coding</h2>
<p>I did my Undergraduate Honors Thesis, ``Gradient Origin Predictive Coding'',
   under Dr. Rajesh Rao. In short, I created an encoder-less VAE
   that performed inference using the gradient of the variational loss. You can
   find the thesis document <a href="gopc.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. 
</p>


<h2>PASTIS</h2>
<p>In the Noble Lab, I helped develop
   <a href="https://github.com/hiclib/pastis" target="_blank">PASTIS</a>, a
   Poisson-based algorithm that infers 3-D chromatin structures from Hi-C
   contact count maps.
</p>

<h2>Probabilistic Representations in the Brain</h2>
<p>In the summer of 2020, I completed a research fellowship at the Center for
   Neurotechnology. I investigated evidence of probabilistic representations
   in the mouse brain using the primary neuropixels dataset from
   <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1787-x" target="_blank">this paper</a>
   by Dr. Nick Steinmetz. You can find my final presenation, delivered at the
   2020 UW Summer Undergraduate Research Symposium,
   <a href="https://youtu.be/8N6XkkPnRKI" target="_blank">here</a>.
